# 🎯 How to Use Scenarios

**Purpose:** This guide explains how the `01-scenarios/` folder is organized, how to navigate scenario-specific runbooks, and how to contribute new scenarios.

---

## 📂 Scenario Folder Structure Overview

The `01-scenarios/` folder contains scenario-specific runbooks for each supported agent delivery scenario.  
Each scenario folder is self-contained and follows a standardized structure so that any engineer can pick it up and deliver consistently — regardless of region or prior experience with the scenario.

> 💡 **Tip:** Always start with the scenario's `Overview.md` to confirm the scenario matches your customer's use case before proceeding with delivery.

> 📌 **Note:** The `M365-Agent-Templates/` folder is an exception to the standard 4-file structure. It contains **Overview documents only** for each agent template. For detailed setup guides, evaluation test plans, agent packages (.zip), and sample data files, please refer to the original [microsoft/m365-agent-templates](https://microsoft.github.io/m365-agent-templates/) repository.

## 📖 Scenario Folder Structure

Each scenario folder follows a standardized **4-file structure** to ensure consistency, reusability, and clarity across all agent deliveries.  
Below is the standard structure, using **HR Onboarding Agent** as the reference example:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0.Resources/` | Supporting assets such as images, diagrams, and reference files used within the scenario |
| `1.Overview.md` | Business context, objectives, target users, key capabilities, and expected outcomes of the agent scenario |
| `2.Architecture.md` | Solution architecture diagrams, technology stack, integration points, and data flow |
| `3.Runbook.md` | Step-by-step implementation instructions covering configuration, development, testing, and deployment |
| `4.Sample-prompts.md` | Validated prompt examples for agent topics, trigger phrases, and conversation flows |
